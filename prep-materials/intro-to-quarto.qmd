The theme of this lesson is good management of your files and data. In part two
of this week's coursework you will learn how to identify **folders** and
**paths**, and create **Quarto documents**.


# Principles of Reproducibility


## File Management

As boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important
skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends
just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools
used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible
analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important---such as 
file management.

Believe it or not, your computer has **multiple** locations\*\* where files can
be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have
evolved: the "file system" metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses
physical files anymore.  

[This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the
argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers
as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the
laundry hamper approach doesn't play nicely with working in R and creating
Quarto documents.

A good programmer will store files according to the 
[Project TIER protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/). 
More specifically, you will have:

-   a "Stat 250" folder in your Documents folder, containing **all** your
materials associated with STAT 250
-   a sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)
-   separate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice
Activity, Lab)

# Reproducible Documents

Over the last ten years, science has experienced a "reproducibility" crisis.
Meaning, a substantial portion of scientific findings were unable to be
recreated because people didn't sufficiently document the processes they used.
As such, a foundational aspect of scientific research is using tools which allow
others to reproduce your findings.

Enter Quarto---a dynamic document that allows us to interweave R code and
written text in the **same** document. Gone are the days of copying and pasting
the results of your R code into a Word document---breaking the connection
between your analysis and your report. Quarto is here to save the day!
